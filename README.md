Execution Time:
Average execution time for 10x10 image: 0.00000 ms
Average execution time for 100x100 image: 0.06667 ms
Average execution time for 1000x1000 image: 1.20000 ms

Analysis:
Based on the average execution time observed across the three test cases, it is evident that execution time increases as the size of the data grows. This trend highlights the direct relationship between data size and processing time, where larger datasets require more computational resources and time to complete.
